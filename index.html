        <h2>What's an Armadillo?</h2>
        
        <p>Armadillos are New World placental mammals in the order Cingulata with a leathery armour shell.<br>
        <em>WHAT?</em><br>
        That's right, the order Cingulata. Never seeen an armadillo? No worries, pal, I'll hook you up.<br>

        <strong>BAM!</strong> Ain't she a beaut?
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why Should I Care?</h2>
        
        <p>We appreciate your skepticism, but armadillos need our help. While that armored plating may protect against snakes, coyotes, etc., it doesn't do a whole lot of good against cars, trucks, or ATVs. <br>
        So <em>please</em> keep an eye out for your little buddy, the armadillo. And thanks for reading.
